## Brief introduction ##
Plantâ€“insect associations have been a significant component of terrestrial ecology for over 400 million years. Exploring these interactions in the fossil record, through novel perspectives, can give us a window into understanding evolutionary and ecological forces that might have shaped the structure of these interactions. For the past several decades, significant work has been done in documenting, describing and categorizing these interactions in the fossil record. In this work, we propose a bipartite network representation of fossilized plants and different types of herbivory damages on their leaves, to uncover plant-insect interactions and facilitate a more quantitative system-level description of the system. For this study, we focus on four late Paleozoic assemblages from north-central Texas, but the methods used in this work are general and can be applied to any well-preserved fossil flora.

## About data and code ##
The data used in this project has been collected from four Texas paleozoic floras - Williamson Drive (WD), Mitchell Creek Flats (MCF), Colwell Creek Pond (CCP) and South Ash Pasture (SAP), and has been collected by members and associates of the Labandeira Lab at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Washington DC. 
The code is divided into three basic files: data processing, network plotting and properties and statistical analyses. Using these files, one can replicate the results ans figures obtained in the work.
