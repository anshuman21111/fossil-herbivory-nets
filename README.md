## Brief introduction ##
Plantâ€“insect associations have been a significant component of terrestrial ecology for over 400 million years. Exploring these interactions in the fossil record, through novel perspectives, can give us a window into understanding evolutionary and ecological forces that might have shaped the structure of these interactions. For the past several decades, significant work has been done in documenting, describing and categorizing these interactions in the fossil record. In this work, we propose a bipartite network representation of fossilized plants and different types of herbivory damages on their leaves, to uncover plant-insect interactions and facilitate a more quantitative system-level description of the system. For this study, we focus on four late Paleozoic assemblages from north-central Texas, but the methods used in this work are general and can be applied to any well-preserved fossil flora.
